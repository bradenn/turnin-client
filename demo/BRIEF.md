# Project 1
In this assignment, you will work with the C++ standard template library in order to simulate a line.

### Getting Started
Using the provided code for reference, explore the functions and variables associated with the line vector object.
```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <vector>
   
   using std::vector;
   
   int main() {
        vector<string> line;
        return 0;
   }
```
### Tips
In C++11 and up, you can iterate through a vector easily with a for-loop.
```cpp
    for(string temp : line) cout << temp << endl;
```
